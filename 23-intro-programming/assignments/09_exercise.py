# Create 2 circles, 3 triangles and a square of different
#  sizes
# Add the shapes to a list
# 1. Find the total area of all the shapes
# 2. If we wanted to give each shape an x,y coordinate to
    #  position them in space how could we change the classes to achieve that

# Consider representing triangles with 3 side lengths
#  and using Heron's formula to calculate the area.
